Software Test Automation&amp; QA

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

There are a few factors to consider. The first consideration is functionality.  When testing my code, I can use software automated tests in combination with manual testing to get full coverage of my code.  This coverage is important because it means each line is tested.  Through this testing, I can also assure that unintended outcomes occur less, which improves security overall. Finally, I can utilize different methods of software testing in order to assure function and security.  Some of these include, stress testing, unit testing, and integration testing.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I interpret user needs by considering how a user can approach a program.  Consider the idea that I user can take a certain action at each step. At each step it is important to consider the need of the user.  For each of these points, I may ask myself how do I want the user to interact at this step, how will/has a user interacted at this step, and what can I do to facilitate an efficient, secure, and functioning moment for the user. After considering these points, I can describe a plan for what functionalities and layout my program will have, allowing me to incorporate the users needs seamlessly. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach designing software by first considering the problem at hand. Before anything I try to understand exactly what I am trying to accomplish. After getting a clear idea of the goal, I consider potential issues or problems that could occur (common ones).  Next, I try to break down my software into approachable steps.  Finally, I work on each step in an order that allows me to test each step early on in the design.  As a side note, I will try to identify more difficult portions of a project in order to allocate more time for those steps.
